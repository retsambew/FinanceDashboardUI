It is a React-based Finance Dashboard that can display the products in stock, different statistics, and graphical representations of growth.   

This project can be scaled seamlessly and can be connected to an API easily as the data in project is not hard coded but rather defined as JSON objects. This project is completely responsive and, hence can work on any device.
